# Water-Physics
A demo of water physics in Stencyl

# How does it work?
Making water physics in Stencyl is 90% easier than Scratch, because Stencyl have a built-in Box2D engine unlike Scratch where you should write a crap physics engine from scratch. I once attempted to make a WMW clone in Scratch, but ultimately cancelled because the water move so slow and it's barely even playable. 

Basically, a water in a physical puzzle game (like Where's My Water, Happy Glass, Pull Him Out, etc.) acts just like numerous blue balls putting together. So I created 3 kinds of "liquids" (like the one in WMW) in Stencyl with round collision boxes that's smaller than the sprite to make them more resemble actual water than numerous balls. Strangely, delete an actor on scene is called "kill (actor)" in Stencyl. 

After making the liquids, the rest is easy. 

# So, where's an example project? 
Github went crazy last week and I can't upload my stencyl project. 

# Is it free?
Of coz! But you should give a credit to me if you use my example project. 

# I mean Stencyl. 
Exporting a native Windows and Android application isn't free, bu you can create an AIR application out of the exported SWF.
